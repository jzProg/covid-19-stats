# COVID-19 Stats

A simple COVID-19 web app using [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) and utilizing the [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/) open API for fetching the statistics. I used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) library tool for the initial project structure and [React Charts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-charts) for the virus spread graph. Stay safe!

## Setup Instruction

- `npm install` for dependencies
- build with `npm run build`
- run development server with `npm start`
